  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>After being able to successfully do addition in both binary and HEX with ease, I was ready to tackle something new. I wanted to know how computers could actually process characters on a keyboard as numbers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To learn about ASCII and how it is used in computing. I hope to be able to convert between ASCII and English with the use of a spreadsheet and an English to ASCII chart.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I have a formatted spreadsheet which allows the user to type in an ASCII or English word and receive an converted English or ASCII word. I used the variables VLOOKUP and CONCATENATE to help. I have attached my spreadsheet below.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I listened carefully to my teacher (despite various tangents we went off on) and followed instructions closely. I asked sensible questions when I was unsure of anything and used my knowledge of spreadsheets to complete the task easily. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My teacher had said that we should be formatting our spreadsheets to make them look pretty. However, I feel I took this instruction to the extremes, as I spend half an hour picking appropriate colours! Although I had finished the work already, I still think I spent to long on the graphics of the spreadsheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I should spend less time making my spreadsheet pretty and get on with the work. I will, of course, choose good colours and fonts, but I need to primarily focus on getting the task done. That way I should end up with a working spreadsheet that looks pretty and still have some time left.</td>
