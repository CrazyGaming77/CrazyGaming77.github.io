    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I chose a brand new background to make my website feel more bright and happy. I had also found a very annoying bug in my site which prevented snippets of blog posts showing on the home screen.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue to work with my spreadsheets and to try and fix the annoying bug in my site.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Thankfully yes, with the help of Mr Keen and Mr Tansley! </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I asked my teachers for help as I had been struggling with the problem for a week and had gotten nowhere. They helped me to fix the problem. For the spreadsheets, I used my mathematical knowledge and logic to expand on my 'fake shop' idea. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Most of the lesson was dominated by trying to diagnose and fix the problem. However, I worked at home to expand my spreadsheet (see the spreadsheet below).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I donâ€™t have an annoying bug to fix, so I should be able to work on my blog next lesson hopefully!</td>
