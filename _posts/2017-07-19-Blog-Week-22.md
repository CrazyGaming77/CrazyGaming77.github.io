  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>My blog is looking horrendous and I had very few HTML elements to make it look interesting. It was very dreary.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To change the background to make it look less harsh on the eyes (it is currently a frightening shade of green) and to add a better background colour to my container.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Everything looks much better! The colours are less harsh, the container looks nice. It's still quite basic, however.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I used my knowledge of CSS formatting to do what I needed, and I used my common sense and judgement to choose a better background.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found myself short for time, essentially because I was distracted and kept engaging in conversation with my peers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to focus on my work more to maximise the amount of time I have in the lesson to accomplish what I need to.</td>
  </tr>
