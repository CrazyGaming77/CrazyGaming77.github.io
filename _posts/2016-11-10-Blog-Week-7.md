  <td><strong>Starting point:</strong></td>
    <td>Just before half term, I was faced with a fairly boring looking blog and a bare spreadsheet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><strong>Target for this lesson?</strong></td>
    <td>To add an exciting 'featured' scrolling image bar at the top of my site and a separate page for the list of blogs. Also, spreadsheet wise, to implement an income tax system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Did I reach my target? 
    (add details to "Lesson Review")</strong></td>
    <td>Yes, as after hitting a few bumps, the tax system has been successfully implemented into my spreadsheet and is working perfectly. And my image slideshow looks sleek and is implemented nicely!</td>

  <th><strong>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the spreadsheet, I used my mathematical knowledge to take how tax worked in the real world and put it into the language of the spreadsheet. For the image slideshow, I looked at W3Schools for a guide about how to implement a slideshow. I then edited the CSS and HTML to tailor it for my site.</td>

  <tr>
  <th><strong>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to be able to quickly use mathematics to solve problems I have with spreadsheets, as most of the problems I encountered boiled down to simple mathematical error. </td>

  <tr>
  <th><strong>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall think more carefully about how things work in the real world to help me put it into a spreadsheet.</td>
