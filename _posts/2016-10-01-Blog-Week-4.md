  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by my knowledge of the program. As I am unfamiliar with many of the commands available, I can only do basic things in a spreadsheet.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I shall further investigate the different commands available in my spare time so I can do more than just basic mathematical functions in a spreadsheet.</td>
