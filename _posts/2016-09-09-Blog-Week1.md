    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration. I also took notes to ensure I was following the instructions perfectly.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lots of people were asking stupid questions, which slowed the lesson down and thus prohibited me from reaching my full educational potential. Also, lots of people were trying to distract me.

I need to improve my concentration span, as I got distracted pretty easily in this lesson. This was bad and needs to be improved immediately.</td>

    <td>Always be ready to make notes so that I don't forget. I will also try my best not to get distracted by the people around me.</td>
