  <tr>
    <td>Lots of people were asking stupid questions, which slowed the lesson down and thus prohibited me from reaching my full educational potential. Also, lots of people were trying to distract me.<br /> <br />I need to improve my concentration span, as I got distracted pretty easily in this lesson. This was bad and needs to be improved immediately.</td>
