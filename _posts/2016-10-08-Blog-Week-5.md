    <td>I had played around with the .scss file and spreadsheets to further my knowledge and add finishing touches to the look of my website.</td>

  <td><strong>Target for this lesson?</strong></td>
    <td>To input youtube videos into my blog and make it look nice.</td>

    <td><strong>Did I reach my target? 
    (add details to "Lesson Review")</strong></td>
    <td>Yes (see below for the video I put in).</td>

    <th><strong>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</strong> </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I looked up 'How to input YouTube videos in websites' on the internet and found a very helpful video which also explained how to change various aspects such as the look of it and how to get rid of the play bar (see video below for details).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could not get much done in the lesson as my classmates were asking me for help with their website. While some my find this annoying, I enjoy it, as it gives me a chance to refine my trouble spotting skills and help people at the same time. This does mean, however, that the majority of the work I do on my own site happens at home (which I have no problem with by the way).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><strong>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to focus a little more on my own blog rather than just helping people with their problems. However, I will not completely ‘abandon’ them, I shall just encourage them to seek help from the teacher rather than me. </td>
