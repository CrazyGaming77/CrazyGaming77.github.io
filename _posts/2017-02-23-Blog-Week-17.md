    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had been going over some python commands and was revisiting Codecademy to revise python. I had a session on repl.it with advanced python commands.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To learn about 'for' loops, ‘while’ loops, variables and other aspects of python in preparation for a large task. Our task is to create a python calculator that offers a variety of functions for the user to choose from and carries them out effectively.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I have grasped the idea of ‘for’ and ‘while’ loops and have made a good start on my python calculator. I hope to add to it to make it more sophisticated.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I listened carefully to instructions. I also remembered the parts of python I remembered learning from Year 8. This allowed me to complete the given tasks easily and quickly, meaning I could start my calculator.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson felt a little rushed. This was largely due to the depth of explanation of the commands given by my I.T teacher. Although this meant I had less time to complete the task, I was grateful, as it allowed me to fully understand how to use the commands we were taught.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next week I will continue to listen intently to instructions and will not be distracted by my peers. I shall take advantage of detailed explanations from my teacher, and ask relevant questions where necessary. This will allow me to have a greater understanding of the subject.</td>
